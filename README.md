## Process

The project started with the idea of creating a useful medical app. We initially searched a medical trained prediction model, fundamental build our app.

We created a user story and listed all minimum functionalities we wanted for our app.
 
We then allocated a time frame for each task outlined and logged our progress and remaining tasks.

(to be continued)

Every time a new functioning feature was completed, its branch was merged to the Development branch and pushed to the main git repository. At the end all final changes were merged with the master branch.

## Inital User Story

###Â Must have's 
    UI
    - user can create a profile 
    - user can log in with autentication
    - user can input data (form)
    
    server side:
    - server receives user data (eg. API call)
    - server create user profile and store (model user table)
    - server store user profile with data set (eg. user history table)
    - server use models to analyze data received (eg. symptoms)
